Body_Mass_Index : Basic procedural program. Prompts user for height in inches and weight in pounds and calculates and prints BMI to screen

Body_Mass_Index_with_if : Extension of basic BMI program. Includes and if/elif/else block to tell the user wether they are considered underweight, normal weight, overwieght or obese based on the calculated BMI

Body_Mass_Index_with_if_and_while: Further extension of BMI program. Includes a while loop that allows user to process repeated entries

Body_Mass_Index_Validation_Functions: Breaks down program into a main function, a get weight function and a get height function. get_weight() and get_height() functions utilize while loops and if statements for validation to ensure that only valid values are returned to main function to be used in calculations
